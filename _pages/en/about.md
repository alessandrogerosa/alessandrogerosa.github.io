Hi! I am Alessandro Gerosa, an Assistant Professor in Cultural Sociology at the department of Social and Political Science, University of Milan.

I am a `sociologist`. My research analyses how people seek `authentic` and `meaningful` lives in `late modern capitalism` through `consumption` and production practices, from a `cultural` and `critical` perspective. My recent research projects focus on the `neo-craft` consumption and `work`, `digital cultures`, and `urban transformation` processes. My ongoing (self-funded) research project aims to analyse the collective, organisational dimension of neo-craft work through the case study of critical winemakers.

I am the author of [The Hipster Economy: Taste and Authenticity in Late Modern Capitalism](https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/230904), published in `Open Access` format by UCL Press (yes, this means you can download the pdf for free from the publishing house!). My book has been featured in a number of magazines and podcasts, check the dedicated page to access them!

I am also the author of a number of academic publications. You can find a selected list below (and the full list in the dedicated page).
