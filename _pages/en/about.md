I am a librarian and I work as an Open Access Manager in the [Service Group for Publication Services](https://www.tuwien.at/en/library/publishing) of [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/)'s [university library](https://www.tuwien.at/en/library).

I did my two-year preparatory service working at the [university library](https://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/home_en) of the [Goethe University](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en?locale=en) in Frankfurt. There, I received a [master's in library and information science](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/studium/studiengaenge/fernstudium) from the [HU Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and, from the German state of Hessia, I received my state exams qualification as an assessor of library services.

I did my PhD at the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/en/) of the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/). The focus of my academic research was on the semantics and pragmatics of conditionals, specialising on accounting for the felicity distribution of reverse Sobel sequences. The main goal of my research was to further the debate between the dynamic strict approach and the variably-strict approach to modelling conditionals. My thesis supervisors were [Maribel Romero](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/romero/), [María Biezma](https://mariabiezma.com/), and [Regine Eckardt](https://www.ling.uni-konstanz.de/eckardt/personen/prof-dr-regine-eckardt/).
